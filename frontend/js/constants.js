The uniform design also contains some elements from Captain America and Captain Marvel costume. Have you ever wonder how it would look like if we randomly mix the facial features, physicals build and skin tones of Oscar best actors and actresses and have them wearing a starship uniform? well, this is what Unknown Federation NFT Collection is all about. To create the best looking starship crew the world have ever seen, and I bet the production cost of this tv series will be expensive too :D I wonder how the starships would look like ;)';
